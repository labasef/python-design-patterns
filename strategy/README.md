# Strategy Design Pattern in Python

## Introduction

The **Strategy Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that allows a client to choose from a family of algorithms or behaviors at runtime. Instead of implementing many variations of the algorithm inside a class, the strategy pattern defines a set of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This allows the algorithm to be selected based on the context, enhancing flexibility and scalability.

In Python, the strategy pattern can be implemented by defining a base class for the strategy and then creating concrete implementations of that base class.

## Use Case

The strategy pattern is useful when you have multiple methods or algorithms that perform similar tasks but with slightly different approaches. You can select which strategy to use without changing the client code that uses it.

## Example in Python

Below is an example that demonstrates the Strategy design pattern in Python.

### Step 1: Define the Strategy Interface

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class PaymentStrategy(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def pay(self, amount: float):
        pass
```
This is the abstract strategy class that all concrete strategies will implement. The pay method must be implemented by any strategy.
### Step 2: Create Concrete Strategies

```python
class CreditCardPayment(PaymentStrategy):
    def pay(self, amount: float):
        print(f"Paid {amount} using Credit Card.")

class PayPalPayment(PaymentStrategy):
    def pay(self, amount: float):
        print(f"Paid {amount} using PayPal.")

class BitcoinPayment(PaymentStrategy):
    def pay(self, amount: float):
        print(f"Paid {amount} using Bitcoin.")
```
Here, we've created three concrete strategies that implement the pay method in different ways: credit card, PayPal, and Bitcoin.
### Step 3: Create the Context Class
```python
class ShoppingCart:
    def __init__(self, payment_strategy: PaymentStrategy):
        self.payment_strategy = payment_strategy

    def checkout(self, amount: float):
        self.payment_strategy.pay(amount)
```
The ShoppingCart class is the context that uses a PaymentStrategy. The strategy is passed in when the shopping cart is initialized.
### Step 4: Use the Strategy Pattern
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Using CreditCardPayment strategy
    cart = ShoppingCart(CreditCardPayment())
    cart.checkout(100)

    # Using PayPalPayment strategy
    cart = ShoppingCart(PayPalPayment())
    cart.checkout(200)

    # Using BitcoinPayment strategy
    cart = ShoppingCart(BitcoinPayment())
    cart.checkout(300)
```
In the main function, the client can easily switch between different payment methods without modifying the core logic of the shopping cart.
Advantages of the Strategy Pattern

**Flexibility**: The algorithm can be chosen at runtime.

**Open/Closed Principle**: The context class is open for extension but closed for modification.

**Avoids Multiple Conditional Statements**: Rather than using if-else or switch statements to determine the algorithm, the strategy pattern uses composition and polymorphism.

**Easier Maintenance**: New strategies can be added easily without modifying the existing code.

## Conclusion

The Strategy Pattern is a powerful behavioral design pattern that promotes flexibility and scalability in your code. It allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate them in separate classes, and switch them out as needed without modifying the client code. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple strategies or approaches could be applied to the same problem.
