# Design Patterns

Design patterns are **typical solutions to commonly occurring problems** in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.

You canâ€™t just find a pattern and copy it into your program, the way you can with off-the-shelf functions or libraries. The pattern is not a specific piece of code, but a general concept for solving a particular problem. You can follow the pattern details and implement a solution that suits the realities of your own program.

Patterns are often confused with algorithms, because both concepts describe typical solutions to some known problems. While an algorithm always defines a clear set of actions that can achieve some goal, a pattern is a more high-level description of a solution. The code of the same pattern applied to two different programs may be different.

## Classification of patterns

- Creational patterns provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

- Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

- Behavioral patterns take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

## Criticism

It is important to note that you don't always need to use design patterns in your code. They are a tool to have in your toolbox, not a silver bullet that will solve all your problems. You should not try to use design patterns in every single piece of code you write. It is important to use them only when it makes sense to do so.

Design patterns do provide a high-level of abstraction, but the programming language you are using might already have built-in constructs that are more powerful and flexible than the design patterns that you are using. For example, the Strategy pattern can be implemented with a simple anonymous (lambda) function in Python.
